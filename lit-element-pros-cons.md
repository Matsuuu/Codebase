+ Built-in power of the lit-html library
+ A nice replacement for the HTMLElement base class
+ Gives you a clear data-, and workflow
+ Property-Attribute interop
+ Typescript support
+ Eases the rendering process
+ Effective lifecycle operations
+ A bunch of directives to help out with more special cases
+ The best bang for your buck Web Component Library to date (in my opinion)
